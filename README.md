# Griffin
An easy way to make apps. Project is functional but in Alpha stages of development.


# Install with
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL goo.gl/gkpn6a)"`<br>
create a new file with<br>
`griffin new`<br>
(creates new.grif)<br>
Turn that file into a dev-app with <br>
`griffin new.grif`<br>
(creates new.Grif.app and opens it)<br>


# How Griffin works
Griffin just uses several existing tools and makes them easy to access
- pug (for html)
- sass (for css)
- coffee script (for JavaScript)
- electron (turns html,css, and Javascript into an app)

# TODO
Create VS Code syntax hilighting<br>
Add optional install of VS Code<br>
Add optional setup of VS Code<br>
